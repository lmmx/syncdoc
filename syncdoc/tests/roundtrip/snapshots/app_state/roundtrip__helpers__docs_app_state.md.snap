The core state machine bridging document sections and the interactive editor.

A TUI needs a single source of truth that can be interrogated and mutated as the user navigates
and edits. We achieve this by syncing the editor save state with the files on disk. We keep
track of the cumulative total number of lines that have been added to the file during the
session so that we can determine the correct offset to insert content at without re-parsing.
