Apply all edits in the plan using textum patches.

Groups edits by file and uses textum's `PatchSet` to apply all changes
atomically per file. Each edit targets a line range and replaces the
content between those lines with the new section content.

# Errors

Returns an error if file operations, patching, or line number conversion fails.
